<b>Malaria Diagnosis Model</b><br/>
This project represents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the binary classification of blood image samples into parasitized (P) and uninfected (U) categories. The model is designed to assist in the diagnosis of malaria by analyzing blood smear images. <br/>
<b>Dataset</b><br/>
The dataset is sourced from TensorFlow Datasets and includes images of blood smears that are either parasitized or uninfected.<br/>
<b>Model Architechture</b><br/>
Convolutional layers<br/>
Normalization layers<br/>
MaxPooling layers<br/>
Fully Connected layers<br/>
